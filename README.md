The impact of musical tempo on self-reported mental health conditions


Mental health issues have always been a worldwide issue which requires high quality and effective treatment which could be costly. Mental health issues refer to a condition that interferes with mood, thinking and behavior. Mental health issues can have multiple causes, for instance childhood abuse, bereavement, unemployment, long-term stress, bullying etc. If this issue is neglected and not treated properly, may lead to mental disorders, for example Bipolar Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Schizophrenia etc. which will require great effort long-term treatment. 

 
There are three main types of treatment for mental health issues which are psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and pharmaceutical treatment. Psychotherapy begins with patients sharing personal thoughts and feelings via conversation and mental health professionals will identify and change the psychological root cause such as behaviors, thoughts and emotions. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment that sends electric current through the brain and intentionally triggers seizure that aims to relieve severe symptoms of mental health. Pharmaceutical treatment which can reduce the symptoms of mental health issue by taking medications, examples are antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, depressants, anxiolytics, and stimulants.  

 
Although the three treatments mentioned are the most commonly used treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment may vary on personal mental health condition while also might bring some negative side effect. Based on the research on effectiveness of music therapy (MT) and psychotherapy on treating depression shows that music therapy has better improvement on patients’ symptoms. Besides Castillo-Pérez also found that music can be effective in treating disorders such as management of acute pain, cancer pain and labor pain. (Castillo-Pérez et al., 2010).  

 
Furthermore, Jane Edwards says that music therapy proven to be a beneficial intervention people with persistent mental illness (Edwards, 2006). Thus, this project is aimed to investigate on the potential benefits of MT and explore correlation between the impact of the exploratory of respondents, musical tempo quantified as Beats per Minute (BPM), and the results on self-reported mental health conditions. This project uses the dataset of “Music & Mental Health Survey Results” available from Kaggle which aims to bridge the gap between musical preferences and mental well-being.  


 Problem Statement : 

Over the years, mental health issues have been increasing significantly over the year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 970 million people globally suffering mental disorders in 2019. While this number increases by 26% and 28% on anxiety and major depressive disorders which are the common mental disorders in 2020 (World Health Organization, 2022). The most common causes of mental health issue are stress which could be due to psychosocial (unhappiness, low self-esteem, overthinking, etc.) or environmental factors (poverty, racial and ethnic discrimination, economic injustice, etc.) (Choudhry et al., 2016).  This issue impacted people of all ages and requires demanding attention. Therefore, MT which easy to access, better improvement in treatment while less costly ($50-$90 per session (Klemm, 2020)) compared to psychotherapy ($100-$200 per session (Lauretta, 2021)) is said to be an optimal solution to mental health issue. However, different levels of BPM of music will impact on heart rate, listening with music that’s not optimum to individual’s condition may cause anxiety or irritability which worsen the symptoms. Thus, this study aims to predict the individual’s mental health condition based on BPM.  


Project objectives:
 

To identify the correlation between BPM and individual moods  

To model the prediction on BPM based on parameters.  

To evaluate the prediction of individual’s mental health condition based on parameters.  

Discover the relationship between musical tempo (BPM) and conditions of an individual, i.e., Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD 

Discover the relationship between musical tempo (BPM) and effects on self-reported mental health conditions, i.e., Improvements in Mental Health.
